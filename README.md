# Hill-climbing-with-python
This repo is made to show 3 types of hill climbing algorithm to solve N-Queens problem

The tests are on 4x4, 6x6, 8x8 boards of N-Queens problems
1. Simple Hill climbing (1000 test cases per board)
2. Hill climbing with Random Restart (1000 test cases per board)
  a) with no limit on number of random restarts 
  b) with limit = 1.5* board_size on number of random restarts
3. Hill climbing with simulated annealing (100 test cases per board)
